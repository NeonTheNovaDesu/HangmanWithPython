# HangmanWithPython
I made a game with python for a university "Special Topics in Programming". I may improve it because this version was made in hurry< br / > 

this game has 2 modes (PvP and PvB) and 4 difficulties< br / > 
in PvE you have to play with words that Bot choose for you< br / > 
in PvP you have to play with words that your opponent choose and they have to answer words that you choose for them< br / > 

Main6.exe ( 12,438 KB ) : this file is an executable sample of the game that you can run without download libararies on your pc locally< br / > 
Main6.py ( 16 KB ) : this file is where codes has been written (it dosen't contain hints at this time i will add them in the future)< br / > 
word.py ( 11 KB ) : this file contains words that will be used in the PvB mode< br / >
