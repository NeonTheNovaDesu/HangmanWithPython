# HangmanWithPython
I made a game with python for a university "Special Topics in Programming". I may improve it because this version was made in hurry

this game has 2 modes (PvP and PvB) and 4 difficulties 

in PvE you have to play with words that Bot choose for you

in PvP you have to play with words that your opponent choose and they have to answer words that you choose for them

Main6.exe ( 12,438 KB ) : this file is an executable sample of the game that you can run without download libararies on your pc locally

Main6.py ( 16 KB ) : this file is where codes has been written (it dosen't contain hints at this time i will add them in the future)

word.py ( 11 KB ) : this file contains words that will be used in the PvB mode
